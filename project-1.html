        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is about researching the impact of renewable energy, and how effective it is for lowering CO2 emissions. I look at two datasets, one on developing countries and their CO2 emissions, and one on global CO2 emissions and their types.</p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul class="features-list">
            <li>EDA</li>
            <li>Hypothesis testing</li>
            <li>Clustering</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
            There were several challenges in this project. There was a lot of missing data, and some of the columns were formatted in a way that was unusable. The way that I dealt with that was just to preprocess the data, omitting the missing values for the first dataset, as they were unnecessary for the plots and hypothesis testing I was doing.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
            Another challenge was researching sustainable energy and understanding the data, structuring the project to be easily understandable. This took some time, but with some reading and research, I completed the job.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
            The final challenge was creating the choropleth map, which required formatting the dataset's country names to match Plotly's required format.
