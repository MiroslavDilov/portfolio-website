        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This machine learning project aimed at exploring and predicting factors that significantly influence students' academic performance. I used different ML algorithms, and aimed to find the most well performing one, and used these models to find the most important features for it.</p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul class="features-list">
            <li>Clustering</li>
            <li>Predictive Modeling</li>
            <li>Feature analysis</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
            The first challenge, as with most machine learning projects, was the data, since it wasn't clean. I preprocessed it, and went on to clustering, which was also quite tough to interpret, since the clusters had revealed a weird way that the grades were formatted 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
            The models, chosing what models to compare, and how, was another difficult challenge. I settled on comparing the r-score, MSE, and MAE. The most difficult thing with the models, was that there were a lot of columns that were correlated with one another, which introduced multicolinearity. This was tough to weed out, as I had to run VIF, to find the features that were highly correlated, and remove them. This is the reason why before running the training on the models, I have removed so many columns
